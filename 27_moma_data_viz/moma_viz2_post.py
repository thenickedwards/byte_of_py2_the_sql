# Week 4 Workshop Assignment Notebook

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP
Before you run any cells in this Notebook, make sure that you have uploaded **momaviz.sql** via this Notebook's file browser. Refresh the file browser and make sure you see it there. Then, run the cells below, one by one.

If afterward at any point, your connection to the runtime is lost, make sure once you re-connect that the **momaviz.sql** file still exists in the file browser. If it no longer exists, upload it again. If any of the green check marks are gone next to the code cells in this ENVIRONMENT SETUP section, start from the top and re-run all the cells in this section.

The code cells within the section for each task can be run independently of each other, as long as all ENVIRONMENT SETUP cells have been run.

The following cell is used to install and start a Postgres server:
"""

!sudo apt-get -y -qq update
!sudo apt-get -y -qq install postgresql
!sudo service postgresql start

"""The next two cells will drop the **moma** database on that Postgres server, if it exists, and create a new one:"""

!sudo -u postgres psql -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS moma;'

!sudo -u postgres psql -c 'CREATE DATABASE moma;'

"""Next, run the following cell to add data from moma_viz.sql to the moma database:"""

!sudo -u postgres psql moma < momaviz.sql

"""Run the following cell to update the default password for the Postgres database:"""

!sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"

"""Finally, run the following cell to import the packages you'll use in this exercise, and open a database connection and cursor to the Postgres server with psycopg. You will see a UserWarning about the psycopg2 wheel package. You can ignore this warning, as long as you see a green check mark after running the cell."""

import psycopg2
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=moma user=postgres password=postgres host=localhost port=5432")
conn.set_session(autocommit=True)

cur = conn.cursor()

"""Run the following cell to make available the same sql_to_df function you have used in this week's exercises:"""

def sql_to_df(sql_query: str):
    """Get result set of sql_query as a pandas DataFrame."""
    return pd.read_sql(sql_query, conn)

## TASK 1 - ARTWORKS BY DEPARTMENT

Run the following cell to test the SQL query you devised in Task 1: Part 1.
For this task, the query has been provided for you as an example, so you do not need to do anything except run the cell. And of course, examine the query and do your best to understand how it works!

## TASK 2 - ARTISTS BY CLASSIFICATION

## TASK 5 - BONUS

This is an optional task. For this task, the code has been completed for you. Your task is to run the cell, examine the SQL query and the results, and come up with an appropriate title and assign it to the value of the title variable. You can compare it with the solution shown in the bonus task instructions.
