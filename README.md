# byte_of_py2_the_sql

A second helping of Python, perfect for querying and managing databases, served SQL Ã  la mode with dollop of data insights on top.

## 01 - The README - What's all this then?

This is a repo where I have committed to practicing Python while integrating with SQL databases. Many of the directories are self-explanatory, though there is more info table of contents below.

To spin up the environment, you'll need a docker-compose.yml at the root and a .env file with the name of your virtual environment and the path to activate it. Then simply run:

`source ./byte_of_py2_the_sql.sh start`
OR
`. ./byte_of_py2_the_sql.sh start`

This will activate the virtual environment, compose up the Docker containers, and open pgAdmin at http://localhost:5433/ in a browser.

To shut down, run the same command withour the `start` parameter.
